  <h2>Text selection</h2>
  <p>
    For each version, the text is transcribed from the incipit of Book I
    up to the second poetic section.
    The dedicatory letter in the 1505 edition is treated as a separate paratextual section
    and is not included in the parallel comparison.
  </p>

  <h2>Parallel comparison</h2>
  <p>
    The three versions (Q, 1505, 1553) are presented as autonomous texts.
    They are aligned by macro-textual units (Prose 1 → Verses 1 → Prose 2 → Verses 2)
    in order to enable a parallel comparison without conflating the textual traditions.
  </p>

  <h2>Critical apparatus</h2>
  <p>
    A selective negative critical apparatus is used to document significant textual variants
    between the versions, without attempting to reconstruct a single archetypal text.
